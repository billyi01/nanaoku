[assessment] patients with tumors originating on the right side of the colon (hepatic flexure through cecum) are unlikely to respond to cetuximab and panitumumab in first-line therapy for metastatic disease. EGFR(+), KRAS/NRAS WT gene and left-sided tumor - panitumumab is purchased and will be ready for the patient in days. immune checkpoint inhibitors might not an ideal option for non-dMMR/MSI-H tumor - MLH1(focal +), MSH2(+), MSH6(+). according to CEA lab data, the condition might not be improved after one year FOLFIRI. [suggestion] might order CT scan to gather new evidence on treatment effect. If evidence shows that the cancer is getting more advanced, then shift FOLFIRI to FOLFOX or CAPEOX (each regimen can be used in combination with bevacizumab) could be considered. {substance dependence} [subj/obj] lab test showed evidence of using addictive drug.
