MCV almost touched the upper limit of the normal range, some folic acid and/or vit B12 supplements might be helpful for the mild anemia. some laxative agent might be helpful for the ileus. [suggestion] keep abx using and monitoring changes of infection signs. invite dietitian to help the patient to eat more salted diets and to see if any other diet issue found, then get sodium tested few days later. order regular scheduled blood sugar tests to build its trend. folacin (folic acid 5mg) and/or kentamin (thiamine 50mg, pyridoxine 50mg, cyannocobalamin 500mcg) are available in pharmacy inventory now, each of them could be administrated QD or BID, which is recommended. if still no defecation before 2021-05-11, then dulcolax (bisacodyl 5mg) QD or BID could be considered to prescribe, and administrated until defecation or 3 days then reevaluate the condition. 3.2 700350999 3.2.1 210510 {problem list} active problems listed in 2021-05-08 14:14 DutyNote containing 2 items: - urinary tract infection - right lower lung pneumonia [subj/obj] admitted on 2021-05-08 for lethargy, weakness for 5 days and fever for 1 day. with underlying HFrEF, bladder cancer s/p TURBT, HCVD, CKD and DM, been regularly followed up at our cardiology, urology, metabolism departments. bladder cancer causing voiding difficulties and UTI K 3.1mmol/L (2021-05-10), 3.1mmol/L (2021-05-08) BUN 123mg/dL (2021-05-10), 101mg/dL (2021-05-08) Creatinine 4mg/dL (2021-05-10), 3mg/dL (2021-05-08) eGFR 15 (2021-05-10), 20 (2021-05-08) CRP 8.63 (2021-05-10), 5.31 (2021-05-08) RBC 410^6/uL (2021-05-10), 3.710^6/mL (2021-05-08) HGB 11.6g/dL (2021-05-10), 10.8 (2021-05-08) MCV 84.8 fL (2021-05-10), 86.2 fL (2021-05-08) urine OB 2+, sediment-RBC 6-9, sediment-WBC &gt;= 100, Bacteria 3+ (2021-05-08) hs-Troponin I 385pg/mL (2021-05-08) serum glucose 177mg/dL (2021-05-08), records fluctuate between 126-226 from 2021-05-08 19:00 to 2021-05-10 11:30.

MCV almost touched the lower limit of the normal range, some iron supplements might be helpful for boosting up the hemoglobin level. uric acid seems fell into normal range for months, xanthine oxidase inhibitor could be no more necessary. [suggestion] keep abx using and monitoring any change of infection signs. invite dietitian to help the patient to get more potassium-containing food, and/or consider to shift uretropic (furosemide) to potassium sparing spironolactone. foliromin (ferrous sodium citrate, 50mg) BID for 2-4 weeks to levelup hemoglobin is recommended, administrated in combination with vit C to help absorption can be considered. if there is no special consideration, discontinuation feburic (febuxostat) is recommended. 3.3 700385854 3.3.1 210507 {colon cancer} [subj/obj] diagnosed with sigmoid adenocarcinoma in 2020 Apr with liver, paraaortic LNs, and peritoneal carcinomatosis, cT3N2bM1c, stage IVc. received FOLFIRI 80% dose and 11 times panitumumab from May to Oct in 2020 at Taoyuan General Hospital of Ministry of Health and Welfare. patho colon biopsy on 2020-11-26 showed one huge tumor was noted at sigmoid colon (30cm from anal verge) and the lumen was near completely obstructed. colonic tissue with invasive irregular neoplastic glands. immunohistochemical stains reveal CDX2(+) EGFR(+), PMS2(+), MLH1(focal +), MSH2(+), and MSH6(+). received FOLFIRI 6 times from 2020 Nov to 2021 Mar (C1D1, C1D15, C2D1, C2D15, C3D1, C3D15) in our hospital prior to this hospitalization. NRAS/KRAS reported on 2020-12-15 showing not detected. CEA 16.62ng/mL(2021-01-26), 8.52ng/mL(2020-11-17). BRAF lab data not found. [assessment] patients with tumors originating on the right side of the colon (hepatic flexure through cecum) are unlikely to respond to cetuximab and panitumumab in first-line therapy for metastatic disease. EGFR(+), KRAS/NRAS WT gene and left-sided tumor - panitumumab is purchased and will be ready for the patient in days. immune checkpoint inhibitors might not an ideal option for non-dMMR/MSI-H tumor - MLH1(focal +), MSH2(+), MSH6(+). according to CEA lab data, the condition might not be improved after one year FOLFIRI. [suggestion] might order CT scan to gather new evidence on treatment effect. If evidence shows that the cancer is getting more advanced, then shift FOLFIRI to FOLFOX or CAPEOX (each regimen can be used in combination with bevacizumab) could be considered. {substance dependence} [subj/obj] lab test showed evidence of using addictive drug. [assessment] should help the patient get rid of those illegal drugs. [suggestion] might arrange or refer the patient to an addiction treatment center or clinic to get some alternative e.g. methadone. {returning to society} [subj/obj] his family members avoid to contact him. no job, no income not standing on his own feet yet (financially) [assessment] being not reintegrated to the society will push him closer to the additive drugs.
