RegoNivo regimen is supported by articles, e.g. “Regorafenib Plus Nivolumab in Patients With Advanced Gastric or Colorectal Cancer” possible toxicity for RegoNivo regimen nivolumab can result in significant immune-mediated adverse reactions due to T-cell activation and proliferation. These immune-mediated reactions may involve any organ system, with the most common reactions being pneumonitis, enterocolitis, hepatitis, dermatitis, hypophysitis, nephritis, and thyroid dysfunction. regorafenib: hypertension occurs in nearly 30% of patients. usually occurs within 6 weeks of starting therapy and is well controlled with oral antihypertensive medications. skin toxicity in the form of hand-foot syndrome and skin rash occur in up to 45% and 26%, respectively. generally appears within the first cycle of drug treatment. [suggest/plan] monitor any sign of toxicity caused by nivolumab and regorafenib. keep tracking tumor markers including CEA update chest, abdomen, and pelvic CT (and/or PET) every 3-6 months. 3.5 700350999 3.5.1 210510 {problem list} active problems listed in 2021-05-08 14:14 DutyNote containing 2 items: - urinary tract infection - right lower lung pneumonia [subj/obj] admitted on 2021-05-08 for lethargy, weakness for 5 days and fever for 1 day. with underlying HFrEF, bladder cancer s/p TURBT, HCVD, CKD and DM, been regularly followed up at our cardiology, urology, metabolism departments. bladder cancer causing voiding difficulties and UTI K 3.1mmol/L (2021-05-10), 3.1mmol/L (2021-05-08) BUN 123mg/dL (2021-05-10), 101mg/dL (2021-05-08) Creatinine 4mg/dL (2021-05-10), 3mg/dL (2021-05-08) eGFR 15 (2021-05-10), 20 (2021-05-08) CRP 8.63 (2021-05-10), 5.31 (2021-05-08) RBC 4x10^6/uL (2021-05-10), 3.7x10^6/mL (2021-05-08) HGB 11.6g/dL (2021-05-10), 10.8 (2021-05-08) MCV 84.8 fL (2021-05-10), 86.2 fL (2021-05-08) urine OB 2+, sediment-RBC 6-9, sediment-WBC &gt;= 100, Bacteria 3+ (2021-05-08) hs-Troponin I 385pg/mL (2021-05-08) serum glucose 177mg/dL (2021-05-08), records fluctuate between 126-226 from 2021-05-08 19:00 to 2021-05-10 11:30.
